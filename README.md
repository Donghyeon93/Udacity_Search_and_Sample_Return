Perspective transform from rover camera image to top view has been processed both images are shown at the botton left side. In top view image obstacle is marked as red, navigatable terratin as blue, and rock sample as white. Global map is shown at botton right side. Fildelity and percent of mapped terrain are shown as values.

At the end of video rover has mapped 43% of entire world map, which meets the requirement of 40%. Also around 70% of fidelity meets requirement of 60%. Also rover has discovered 3 rock samples which is marked as white.
